      <h3>
        Hello! I'm Michelle Yang.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I've recently graduated from the University of Washington
        in Seattle, WA with a BS in Computer Science and minors in
        Math and Chemistry. I will be beginning full-time with
        Facebook in Seattle at the end of April.<br><br>
        (Autumn 2016) I started at UW after 10th grade through a
        program called the UW Academy at the Robinson Center.<br><br>
        (Summer 2018) After my sophomore year in college, I interned
        at Salesforce in their Bellevue office, where I got an
        introduction to Kubernetes, Docker, Spark, Jupyter, Jackson/
        JSON, and Nginx by working with two other interns in making
        a notebook application that worked with the existing code base.
        I containerized our application with Docker, helped expose/
        deserialize/apply customizable Spark options to users, and
        exposed the Spark UI and history UI to the application.<br><br>
        (Summer 2019) The summer after, I interned at Facebook in
        the Menlo Park office. I worked on a team that provided a
        distributed system shuffle service between executors. My
        internship was focused on improving memory efficiency: I
        improved memory usage by ~1.5% by rewriting per-row metadata
        into per-package and then worked on increasing the number of
        reducers supported in Spark jobs from currently 10,000 to
        120,000 (using same amount of memory) by rewriting mapper
        to shuffle service packages.<br><br>
        (Winter 2020) During my last quarter at UW, I interned with
        a startup called Wyze Labs in Kirkland that made extremely
        cheap smart home devices, most well known for their Wyze Cams.
        I worked a bit on various projects, including design planning
        for a data lake, writing APIs, and working with AWS tools to
        provide business intelligence better access to the data.<br><br>

        was walking out after work at Wyze in Kirkland to the bus stop
        on an iPhone 11.<br><br>

        2019) at a Facebook intern event at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk.<br><br>
